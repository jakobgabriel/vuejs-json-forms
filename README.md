# Lightweight Vue App for User Interface based on json


## Purpose

The purpose of the App is to provide a containerized application that utilizes the Vue.js framework to create a lightweight and efficient user interface. The application connects to a single endpoint API that provides data in JSON format. The focus of this application is to acquire and display user data in a user-friendly manner. Its generic purpose is to support a wide range of use cases for data acquisition from users. The application is designed to be highly responsive, intuitive, and resource-efficient, allowing for optimal performance.

## Deployment

1. Ensure that Docker and docker-compose are installed on the target system.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located.
3. Run the command `docker-compose up -d` to start the deployment process in detached mode. This will build the Docker images and launch the services as specified in the docker-compose.yml file.
4. Wait for the process to complete and verify that the containers are running by running the command `docker-compose ps`.
5. Access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to "http://localhost:8080" to view the frontend, or "http://localhost:3000" to interact with the backend API.


## Packages

Thanks to the Vue.js generators package developer (https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-form-generator) for making the app creation process easier and more efficient.
